# A SIMPLE METROIDVANIA PLATFORMER 2D GAME: WINTER KNIGHT PROJECT
The idea of our game is inspired by the famous 2D platformer game Super Mario, in which players control a character to overcome obstacles, collect items, and defeat enemies throughout different levels.

The game is titled “Winter Knight” and is set in a winter-themed environment, which is suitable for the time when this project is carried out, as winter and Christmas are approaching. In the game, the player takes on the role of a UEH student who embarks on an adventure in a winter landscape, exploring various levels to search for treasures in order to pay off academic credit debts, while overcoming different challenges along the way.

The ultimate goal of the game is to defeat the final boss and complete the game. During gameplay, Christmas-themed items are randomly placed along the path to enhance the player’s abilities and increase the overall enjoyment and engagement of the game.
